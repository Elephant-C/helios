## Background

LiDAR (Light and Ranging Detection) technology has now become the quintessential technique for collecting geospatial data from the earth's surface. This project allows the generation of simulated LiDAR point clouds.

## Install

First install the dependencies, then compile the source code, and finally execute it.

### Dependencies

- Oracle Java 1.8
- Maven 3
- Git

In Ubuntu the these packages can be installed by:
```bash
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer maven git
```

### Compilation

Inside the root folder simply execute:
```bash
mvn package
```

### Eclipse IDE

To add this project to Eclipse go to *File > Import > Existing Maven Projects* and select the root folder.

## Usage

HELIOS supports both single-ray and full-waveform simulations. Currently the default mode is the full-waveform. The selection between this two methods is done in the source code when creating the detector object in *XmlAssetsLoader.java*. 

### Input

The argument of the program is the survey XML file.  See  [Wiki: Basic input data](https://github.com/GIScience/helios/wiki/Quick-start-guide#basic-input-data) for further details. 


### Execution

From the root folder run:

```bash
java -jar target/helios.jar <survey-file>
```
To use the batch mode (no visualization):

```bash
java -jar target/helios.jar <survey-file> headless
```
### Output

Output files are generated inside *output/Survey Playback* folder.
